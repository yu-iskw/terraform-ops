# Terraform-ops CLI Command Overview

The `terraform-ops` tool is a command-line interface for managing Terraform operations.

## Main Application Structure
The core application logic and command definitions are located in [internal/app/app.go](mdc:internal/app/app.go), which uses the `cobra` package to define the CLI commands.

## Packages

### HCL Parsing
The tool utilizes the `hclparse` package from `github.com/hashicorp/hcl/v2/hclparse` for parsing HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) files, as mentioned in [docs/list_providers.md](mdc:docs/list_providers.md).
